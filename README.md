# pps - Primordial Particle System

This program aims to simulate the system in the research article "How a life-like 
system emerges from a simplistic particle motion law."

## Notes

To speed up the simulation, the particles are segregated into blocks with size 
equal to radius r. Hence, we do not need to iterate over all particles twice (n^2), 
but only need to iterate over all particles once then particles within blocks 
nearby (n*m).
